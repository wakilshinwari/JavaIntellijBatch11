abstract classes- they are hundred percent complet
they hide the implementation and only show functianality

It reduces complexity and improves maintainbility

we use abstract classes when we are sure about the method hearder but not about the implementation
header is access movidifieers, return typ, name with arguments

we can delcarea class as abstract without having any abstract methods inside it
once we have at least one abstract mehtod we must delcare that class as absttract
